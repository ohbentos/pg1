Hence, black-box optimization has become increasingly im-portant as systems have become more complex. In this paper we describe Google Vizier, a Google-internal service for per-forming black-box optimization that has become the de facto parameter tuning engine at Google. Google Vizier is used to optimize many of our machine learning models and other systems, and also provides core capabilities to Google's Cloud Machine Learning HyperTune subsystem. We discuss our re-quirements, infrastructure design, underlying algorithms, and advanced features such as transfer learning and automated early stopping that the service provides.},

	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learn- ing residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, in- stead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide com- prehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8× deeper than VGG nets [41] but still having lower complex- ity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our ex- tremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative im- provement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet local- ization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma with the unaided eye is only about 60{\%}. Dermoscopy, a non-invasive, in vivo technique for the microscopic examination of pigmented skin lesions, has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy. Our objectives were to review previous publications, to compare the accuracy of melanoma diagnosis with and without dermoscopy, and to assess the influence of study characteristics on the diagnostic accuracy. We searched for publications between 1987 and 2000 and identified 27 studies eligible for meta-analysis. The diagnostic accuracy for melanoma was significantly higher with dermoscopy than without this technique (log odds ratio 4{\textperiodcentered}0 [95{\%} CI 3{\textperiodcentered}0 to 5{\textperiodcentered}1] versus 2{\textperiodcentered}7 [1{\textperiodcentered}9 to 3{\textperiodcentered}4]; an improvement of 49{\%}, p = 0{\textperiodcentered}001). The diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy significantly depended on the degree of experience of the examiners. Dermoscopy by untrained or less experienced examiners was no better than clinical inspection without dermoscopy. The diagnostic performance of dermoscopy improved when the diagnosis was made by a group of examiners in consensus and diminished as the prevalence of melanoma increased. A comparison of various diagnostic algorithms for dermoscopy showed no significant differences in their diagnostic performance. A thorough appraisal of the study characteristics showed that most of the studies were potentially influenced by verification bias. In conclusion, dermoscopy improves the diagnostic accuracy for melanoma in comparison with inspection by the unaided eye, but only for experienced examiners.},

	abstract = {We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture codenamed "Inception", which was responsible for setting the new state of the art for classification and detection in the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2014 (ILSVRC 2014). The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. This was achieved by a carefully crafted design that allows for increasing the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC 2014 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection.},

@article{Szegedy2016,
	abstract = {Very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question of whether there are any benefit in combining the Inception architecture with residual connections. Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4, we achieve 3.08 percent top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge},
